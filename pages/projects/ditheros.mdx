**DitherOS** is a project I built for fun around DitherLab, a general-purpose *dithering engine* made as an exploration on different dithering techniques and ways to implement them on the web. The project itself explores recreating a desktop-like user interface inspired by the operating systems of the late 1990s and early 2000s.

While DitherLab is the primary feature, I've used DitherOS as something of a playground for any retro-styled applications or games I might want to make for fun. After all, what's a retro OS without a classic time-killer like Minesweeper?

  DitherOS is, naturally, designed as a desktop experience. While it *does* work on mobile devices, don't be surprised if things break and most UI doesn't fit in your phone screen.
